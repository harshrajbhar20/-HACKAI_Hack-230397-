Creating a Temperature Alert Agent involves several steps, including setting up the necessary environment, fetching data from a weather API, and implementing the alert/notification system. Below is a simplified outline of how you can create such a tool using Python and some popular libraries:

1) Set Up Your Environment:

Install Python if not already installed.
Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Install necessary packages using pip, such as requests for API requests and any additional packages for notifications (e.g., smtplib for email notifications).
2) Get API Access:

Find a free weather API service that provides real-time temperature data. Popular options include OpenWeatherMap, Weather API, or Weatherstack.
Sign up for an API key, as you'll need it to make API requests.
Fetch Weather Data:

3) Write a Python script to make HTTP requests to the weather API using your API key and fetch real-time temperature data for the specified location.
Parse the JSON response to extract the current temperature.
User Preferences:

4) Create a user interface for users to set their preferred temperature range and location.
Store user preferences, such as location, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature, in a configuration file or a database.
Alert/Notification System:

5) Implement the alert/notification system based on the user's preferences.
You can use various notification methods, such as:
Sending an email notification using an SMTP library (e.g., smtplib) if the temperature goes out of the specified range.
Sending a text message using an SMS gateway API.
Using a messaging platform like Slack or Telegram for notifications.
Scheduled Checks:

6) Schedule the script to periodically check the current temperature based on the user's preferences.
You can use a scheduler library like schedule or APScheduler to automate this process.
Alert Logic:

7) Compare the fetched temperature with the user's preferred temperature range.
If the temperature falls below the minimum or above the maximum threshold, trigger the notification system.
Logging and Error Handling:

8) Implement logging to keep track of temperature checks and notifications.
Handle errors gracefully, such as network errors or API rate limits.
Testing and Deployment:

9) Test the Temperature Alert Agent thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
Deploy the agent on a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) to run it continuously.
Maintenance:

10) Regularly update the API key if necessary.
Monitor the agent for any issues or failures and perform necessary maintenance.
Remember to handle sensitive user data securely and consider privacy concerns when implementing the alert/notification system. Additionally, you may want to provide options for users to customize notification settings further, such as the frequency of checks and the notification method they prefer.

Below is the code for the problem statement:

import requests
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# API key for OpenWeatherMap (replace with your own)
API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
# Email configuration (replace with your own)
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.example.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587
SMTP_USERNAME = "your_username"
SMTP_PASSWORD = "your_password"
FROM_EMAIL = "your_email@example.com"
TO_EMAIL = "recipient@example.com"

# Location and temperature thresholds
LOCATION = "City, Country"  # Replace with your preferred location
MIN_TEMP_THRESHOLD = 15  # Replace with your preferred minimum temperature
MAX_TEMP_THRESHOLD = 30  # Replace with your preferred maximum temperature

def get_current_temperature():
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={LOCATION}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    current_temperature = data["main"]["temp"]
    return current_temperature

def send_email(subject, message):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = FROM_EMAIL
    msg['To'] = TO_EMAIL
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD)
        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(FROM_EMAIL, TO_EMAIL, text)
        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {str(e)}")

def main():
    current_temperature = get_current_temperature()
    print(f"Current temperature in {LOCATION}: {current_temperature}°C")

    if current_temperature < MIN_TEMP_THRESHOLD:
        send_email("Temperature Alert", f"Temperature in {LOCATION} is below {MIN_TEMP_THRESHOLD}°C.")
    elif current_temperature > MAX_TEMP_THRESHOLD:
        send_email("Temperature Alert", f"Temperature in {LOCATION} is above {MAX_TEMP_THRESHOLD}°C.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
