Project Name : Making a Temperature Alert Agent



Description of the project : 

We have created a Temperature Alert Agent using uAgent library, a tool that:

a) Connects to a free weather API to fetch real-time temperatures for the specified location. 
b) Lets users set their preferred temperature range (e.g., a minimum and maximum temperature) and location. 
c) Sends an alert/notification to the user when the current temperature in their chosen location goes below the minimum or above the maximum threshold they've set.

Instructions to run the project :

Creating a Temperature Alert Agent involves several steps, including setting up the necessary environment, fetching data from a weather API, and implementing the alert/notification system. Below is a simplified outline of how you can create such a tool using Python and some popular libraries:

1.	Install uAgent Library: Start by installing the uAgent library if you haven't already. You can typically install it using a package manager like pip:
     Code : pip install uAgent

2.	Set Up Your Environment:
a.	Install Python if not already installed.
b.	Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
c.	Install necessary packages using pip, such as requests for API requests and any additional packages for notifications (e.g., smtplib for email notifications).

3.	Get API Access:
a.	Find a free weather API service that provides real-time temperature data. Popular options include OpenWeatherMap, Weather API, or Weatherstack.
b.	Sign up for an API key, as you'll need it to make API requests.

4.	Fetch Weather Data:
a.	Write a Python script to make HTTP requests to the weather API using your API key and fetch real-time temperature data for the specified location.
b.	Parse the JSON response to extract the current temperature.

5.	User Preferences:
a.	Create a user interface for users to set their preferred temperature range and location.
b.	Store user preferences, such as location, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature, in a configuration file or a database.

6.	Alert/Notification System:
a.	Implement the alert/notification system based on the user's preferences.
b.	You can use various notification methods, such as:

i.	Sending an email notification using an SMTP library (e.g., smtplib) if the temperature goes out of the specified range.

ii.	Sending a text message using an SMS gateway API.

iii.	Using a messaging platform like Slack or Telegram for notifications.

7.	Scheduled Checks:
a.	Schedule the script to periodically check the current temperature based on the user's preferences.
b.	You can use a scheduler library like schedule or APScheduler to automate this process.

8.	Alert Logic:
a.	Compare the fetched temperature with the user's preferred temperature range.
b.	If the temperature falls below the minimum or above the maximum threshold, trigger the notification system.

9.	Logging and Error Handling:
a.	Implement logging to keep track of temperature checks and notifications.
b.	Handle errors gracefully, such as network errors or API rate limits.

10.	Testing and Deployment:
a.	Test the Temperature Alert Agent thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
b.	Deploy the agent on a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) to run it continuously.

11.	Maintenance:
a.	Regularly update the API key if necessary.
b.	Monitor the agent for any issues or failures and perform necessary maintenance.

Remember to handle sensitive user data securely and consider privacy concerns when implementing the alert/notification system. Additionally, you may want to provide options for users to customize notification settings further, such as the frequency of checks and the notification method they prefer.
