A sample .env file typically contains placeholders for sensitive information like API keys, 
database credentials, and other configuration values that your application needs to function.
Below is a sample .env file with placeholders and instructions on where to get the actual values and how to set them up:

# Sample .env file

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

# API keys
# You can obtain these API keys by signing up for the respective services:
# 1. Google Maps API Key: https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# 2. Twilio API Keys for SMS notifications: https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number

# 3. Stripe API Keys for payment processing: https://stripe.com/docs/development/quickstart
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key

# Application secrets
# These are random strings used for securing your application.
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# Email configuration
# You can set up an email service like SendGrid or use SMTP credentials.
# 1. SendGrid: https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started/
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key

# 2. SMTP Configuration (if not using SendGrid)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Debugging
DEBUG=true

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info

Instructions on how to set up these values:

1) Database Configuration:

DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD should be filled with the actual credentials for your database. Consult your database provider for these details.
2) API Keys:

Obtain API keys for Google Maps, Twilio, and Stripe by following the links provided in the comments. Create accounts, if necessary, and generate the API keys.
3) Application Secrets:

Generate secure random strings for JWT_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET. These are used for securing user sessions and authentication.
4) Email Configuration:

If you use SendGrid, replace SENDGRID_API_KEY with your SendGrid API key. If you use SMTP, fill in SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, and SMTP_PASSWORD with your SMTP server's details.
5) Environment:

NODE_ENV can be set to either development, production, or testing, depending on the environment in which your application is running.
6) Debugging:

Set DEBUG to true during development to enable debugging features if your application supports it.
7) Logging:

Adjust LOG_LEVEL based on your logging preferences (e.g., info, debug, warn, error).
Remember to keep your .env file secure, and do not commit it to version control systems as it contains sensitive information. Use a tool like dotenv to load these values into your application during development. In production, use your hosting provider's environment variable settings to configure these values.
